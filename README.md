# BackUpMaster
BackUpMaster is more than just a data preservation tool; it's a solution for automated and secure backup. It combines user-friendliness with powerful capabilities, helping safeguard critical information reliably.

**Features and Capabilities:**

- **Executable Files for Ease:** The program comes with executable (.exe) files that simplify usage, making it easy to run the program and its components.

- **Configuration Flexibility:** Convenient configuration through `config.ini` allows adjusting paths, compression level, excluded file extensions, and the number of saved copies.

- **Automatic Startup:** The option for BackUpMaster to launch during system startup ensures continuous backup operations.

- **Copy Management:** Automatic management of backup copies, allowing to retain only the necessary number of copies and remove outdated ones.

- **Exclusion of Exclusive Extensions:** The ability to exclude specific file extensions from the compression process provides greater control over the content of backup copies.

- **Logging and Notifications:** Generation of log files for each copy creation process allows tracking results and receiving notifications about success or failure.

- **Graphical Interface:** Through the command-line interface and graphical user interface, you can conveniently interact with the program.

- **Individual Path Settings:** The capability to specify paths to backup and storage folders ensures tool flexibility.

- **Configuration Editor:** A separate configuration editor file is provided, making it even more convenient to manage and fine-tune your backup settings.

**Usage:**

- The primary method of usage involves the executable files: `BackUpMaster.EXE` and `Config.EXE`, which are delivered as a self-extracting archive named `BackUpMaster_install.exe`.
- Upon initial extraction, both executable files will be accessible, and in any case, the configuration tool for initial settings will be launched.
- In the subsequent stages, BackUpMaster.EXE will handle the backup functions, while Config.EXE will be utilized for modifying all settings, including enabling and disabling automatic system startup for backup.
- An alternative approach involves using batch files, although for convenience, it's simpler to utilize the executables, leaving the batch files for direct code manipulation when needed.
- The usage is intuitive and requires no additional explanations.

Your BackUpMaster program offers versatile methods of usage, combining executable files with batch files for seamless and efficient control of backup settings.
